    Hi, everyone, I'm Jacob, and my chinese name is TianXiang Ding.
    I'm very glad join the Enghlish cornor party tonight.
    Haha, I'm from JiangXi province, and get colleage eduaction in NanChang where is provincal capital of JiangXi.
    My major is computer secicence and technology, so now I am working in SheZhen as a programer.
    I'm have been work in ShenZhen about two years.
    Running, Traveling are my hobby, and I always do that in my leisure time.
    Becasue this epidemic I lost my former jobs because the company is breakdown.
    So in the first of 2020, I started to found new job, and funtunately I got a new job in March.
    But the new company have a total different rules, It had loosely and flexiable rule.
    We can do ourself's job at home, It's mean I have more personal time to do my personal things.
    But I don't handle schedule well. If you have some perspective advise me I am very welcome.
    
    I usually study English by reading novels and listening TED or others speechs, But first I study English through 
    some apps like 百词斩 to remenber new vobularies. Honest to say that is so hard to improve Enghlis.
    And is ordeal for me. So I change my approach for study English. I began to reading, it's have context so you can 
    easier to remember new words and how to expression in different scene. After I finished a novel, I will
    to find the novel audio to linsten it again. 
    Through reading and listening, I learn that it's a more effective method than memorize words without context.

    In the end of my self-introduce, I want recruit partner for a triveling about seven days long on 11th next month.
    If you have the common thinking, let me know. 

    Thank you!
