        'I can't stay!' I cried furiously. 'Do you think I can watch another woman become
        your bride? Do you think I'm a machine, without feelings? Do you think, because I'm small
        and poor and plain, that I have no soul and no heart? Well, you're wrong! I have as
        much soul and heart as you. It is my spirit that speaks to your spirit! We are equal in the sight of God!'
