    <h1>Take me to your heart -- Michael Learns To Rock</h1>

    Hiding from the rain and snow <br>
    Trying to forget but I won't let go <br>
    Looking at a crowded street <br>
    Listening to my own heart beat <br>
    So many people all around the world <br>
    Tell me where do I find someone like you girl <br>
    Take me to your heart take to your soul <br>
    Give me your hand before I'm old <br>
    Show me what love is - haven't got a clue <br>
    Show me that wonders can be true <br>
    They say nothing lasts forever <br>
    We're only here today <br>
    Love is now or never <br>
    Bring me far away <br>
    Take me to your heart take me to your soul <br>
    Giver me your hand and hold me <br>
    Show me what love is - be my guiding star <br>
    It's easy take me to your heart <br>
