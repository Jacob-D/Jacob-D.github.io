    I might be lost my humor recently.
    So I search on the Interniet about how to recover humor.
    One comment say that dont't be humor for other people but for your inside.
    The words remind me I must do myself, neglecting others commnet about my behavior.
    How to imporve self-confidence?
    Please follow the four points:
    1. More reading; Books is a window of world, we can learn history, science, literature, economy... 
    Base on these knowledge we can build word-opinion. It can guid myself walk on right way when I sail on the sea.
    2. Insist your standpoint
    Whatever others say to scold you, please don't quit stick with your opinion, maybe your opinion is wrong in the end,
    But you get the finally success because your insist stand on your point.
    3. Jumping out of comfort-zone
    The bravest man is't to do something that others can't do but to do something that you afraid.
    The biggest success is facing the thing of you afraid.
    4. Try to do more things 
    Different experences will enrich your life, "Reading thound of books and traveling thound of mils" is chinese phrase and 
    it suitable for my circumstance.

    FINALLY, BE AN ACTION-MAN!!!
