    Today it's rainy day, I stay at home whole day, and feel really boring, not just today but the whole year. <br>
    Why? Because I get a new job in 2020 that the new enterprise said we can work at home, At first I think it's very
    flexable company rule, it means you can have more free-time, you don't have to spend time on traffic. 
    But when time flow, lonely, anxiety all kinds of unpleasent feeling submerge my mind, because I don't have any chance
    to make new friend, no conversition with colleagues, just single to do my daily work.
    When I say I can work at home, my friends very admire me, they can imagin easier of my job that their job.
    They don't konw that Every thing has two side, you can't simplely conclude result through only one side, it's an ability to 
    comprehensive treat things.
    Basic on my condition, I make the follow list of planning: 
    - career plan, English learning, reading
    - Join some hobby community for make new friend, more colorful life, enrich life
    - When my career plan finished, outsource some project for make money

    Now is pm 22:38, These is my summary of my recently life, and it's my first english diary,
    I wish i can have more lightful tomorrow.
