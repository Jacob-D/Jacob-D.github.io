    Today it's rainy day, I stay at home whole day, and feel really boring, not just today but the whole year. <br>
    Why? Because I get a new job in 2020 that the new enterprise said we can work at home, At first I think it's very <br>
    flexable company rule, it means you can have more free-time, you don't have to spend time on traffic. <br>
    But when time flow, lonely, anxiety all kinds of unpleasent feeling submerge my mind, because I don't have any chance <br>
    to make new friend, no conversition with colleagues, just single to do my daily work. <br>
    When I say I can work at home, my friends very admire me, they can imagin easier of my job that their job. <br>
    They don't konw that Every thing has two side, you can't simplely conclude result through only one side, it's an ability to <br>
    comprehensive treat things.<br>
    Basic on my condition, I make the follow list of planning: <br>
    - career plan, English learning, reading<br>
    - Join some hobby community for make new friend, more colorful life, enrich life<br>
    - When my career plan finished, outsource some project for make money<br>

    Now is pm 22:38, These is my summary of my recently life, and it's my first english diary,<br>
    I wish i can have more lightful tomorrow.
